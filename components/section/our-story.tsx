                        This foundation was born out of a simple but powerful realization —
                        that the sacrifice of Shaheed Bhagat Singh continues to inspire
                        generations, yet remains formally unrecognized at the national level.
                        What began as reflection soon became responsibility.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                        The foundation was started by individuals who believe that remembrance
                        must go beyond words. It was created by citizens, not institutions —
                        people who felt that honoring Bhagat Singh is a moral duty owed by
                        a grateful nation.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                        From the beginning, the focus of this foundation has been singular
                        and unwavering: to seek the conferment of the Padma Shri upon
                        Shaheed Bhagat Singh. There are no parallel agendas, no multiple causes,
                        and no dilution of purpose.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                        This movement stands outside political boundaries. It is not driven
                        by ideology or affiliation, but by justice and recognition.
                        It exists to respectfully remind the nation of a revolutionary
                        who gave everything, expecting nothing in return.
